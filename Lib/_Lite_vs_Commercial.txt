of the following files to compile without errors,
despite the fact that a lot of files from the full
commercial RTC SDK version are NOT included:

  rtcDeploy.inc

All other files are identical between the *LITE* 
and the FULL *commercial* RTC SDK versions, which 
allows you to easily UPGRADE from the latest *LITE* 
RTC SDK version to the latest commercial RTC SDK 
release, simply by following the steps described 
for UPDATING the RealThinClient SDK in Delphi.
